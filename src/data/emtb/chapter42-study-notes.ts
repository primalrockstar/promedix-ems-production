  clinicalPearls: [
    "Coronary blood flow occurs primarily during diastole - tachycardia decreases coronary perfusion time",
    "The heart is a pressure generator, not a volume pump - understanding pressures is key",
    "Cardiac output = heart rate × stroke volume, but the relationship is complex",
    "Compensatory mechanisms in heart failure eventually become part of the problem",
    "The Frank-Starling mechanism has limits - too much preload decreases performance",
    "Afterload reduction can dramatically improve cardiac output in heart failure",
    "The cardiac conduction system has built-in redundancy with backup pacemakers"
