  clinicalPearls: [
    "Understanding normal anatomy helps you recognize abnormal findings during assessment",
    "The body's systems are interconnected - problems in one system affect others",
    "Perfusion (circulation) is essential for all body functions",
    "The nervous system controls everything else - protect it at all costs",
    "Oxygen is the most critical substance for cellular function",
    "Age-related changes affect how body systems respond to illness and injury",
    "Homeostasis mechanisms try to compensate until they can't - then rapid deterioration occurs"
  ],

  rememberThis: [
    "All body systems work together to maintain life",
    "The cardiovascular and respiratory systems are closely linked",
    "The nervous system controls both voluntary and involuntary functions",
    "Understanding anatomy helps predict injury patterns",
    "Normal vital signs vary by age, but the underlying physiology is the same"
