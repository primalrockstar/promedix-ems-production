  clinicalPearls: [
    "Children are not small adults - they have unique anatomical and physiological differences",
    "Normal vital signs vary significantly by age - know the ranges for each age group",
    "Involve parents/caregivers in pediatric care - they know their child best",
    "Older adults may not present with typical symptoms of illness",
    "Development occurs at different rates - focus on individual abilities rather than chronological age",
    "Communication should be age-appropriate but never condescending",
    "Safety concerns and injury patterns vary by developmental stage"
  ],

  rememberThis: [
    "Each life stage has unique characteristics that affect medical care",
    "Normal development follows predictable patterns but varies among individuals",
    "Age-appropriate assessment techniques improve accuracy and patient cooperation",
    "Family dynamics and caregiver involvement vary across the lifespan",
    "Abuse and neglect can occur at any age - maintain high index of suspicion"
  ]
