  ],

  clinicalPearls: [
    "The primary assessment should take no more than 60-90 seconds unless interventions are required",
    "A patient who can speak in full sentences has a patent airway and adequate breathing",
    "Skin color, temperature, and moisture are reliable early indicators of perfusion status",
    "When in doubt about spinal injury, immobilize - you can always remove immobilization later",
    "Trending vital signs is more important than any single measurement",
    "The patient's chief complaint should guide your focused assessment priorities",
    "Never skip the primary assessment, regardless of how stable the patient appears",
    "Reassessment frequency: Critical patients every 5 minutes, stable patients every 15 minutes"
  ],

  criticalActions: [
    "Ensure scene safety before patient contact",
    "Identify and treat life threats during primary assessment",
    "Maintain spinal immobilization when indicated",
    "Establish airway and ventilation as priority",
    "Control major external bleeding immediately",
    "Recognize and treat shock early",
    "Make transport decisions based on assessment findings",
    "Communicate critical findings to receiving facility"
  ],

  commonMistakes: [
    "Rushing through or skipping the primary assessment",
    "Focusing on obvious injuries while missing life threats",
    "Inadequate scene safety assessment",
    "Poor communication with conscious patients",
    "Forgetting to reassess after interventions",
    "Inadequate vital sign measurement technique",
    "Delaying transport for non-critical assessment components",
    "Poor documentation of assessment findings"
  ],

  assessmentCheckpoints: [
    "Can you perform a complete primary assessment in under 90 seconds?",
    "Do you understand when to perform rapid vs. detailed secondary assessment?",
    "Can you properly take a SAMPLE history and use OPQRST for pain assessment?",
    "Are you competent in vital sign measurement and interpretation?",
    "Do you know the normal vital sign ranges for different age groups?",
    "Can you recognize signs of shock and respiratory distress?",
    "Are you able to modify your assessment for pediatric and geriatric patients?",
    "Do you understand proper documentation and communication requirements?"
  ],

  practiceScenarios: [
    "Unconscious trauma patient with suspected spinal injury",
    "Conscious medical patient with chest pain",
    "Pediatric patient with respiratory distress",
    "Multiple trauma patient requiring rapid assessment",
    "Elderly patient with altered mental status",
    "Patient with multiple complaints requiring prioritization"
