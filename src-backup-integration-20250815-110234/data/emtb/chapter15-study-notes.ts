    "Family members often provide the most accurate history for confused patients",
    "Don't discount patient complaints just because vital signs are normal",
    "Ask about recent medication changes - they often trigger new symptoms",
    "Consider medical causes even in apparent trauma situations"
  ],

  criticalActions: [
    "Perform systematic assessment starting with ABCs",
    "Obtain thorough medical history using SAMPLE format",
    "Use OPQRST to analyze chief complaint thoroughly",
    "Assess baseline mental status and any changes",
    "Monitor vital signs serially and trend changes",
    "Identify time-critical medical conditions requiring rapid transport",
    "Communicate effectively with patients and families",
    "Document all findings and interventions completely"

  commonMistakes: [
    "Rushing through history taking to get to treatment",
    "Ignoring patient's own description of their condition",
    "Not asking about medication compliance and recent changes",
    "Assuming normal vital signs mean patient is stable",
    "Failing to establish baseline mental status early",
    "Not involving family members in history gathering",
    "Inadequate documentation of medical history",
    "Missing atypical presentations of common conditions"
  ],

  assessmentCheckpoints: [
    "Can you differentiate medical emergencies from trauma situations?",
    "Are you proficient in obtaining SAMPLE history from medical patients?",
    "Do you understand how to use OPQRST for symptom analysis?",
    "Can you perform appropriate physical examination for medical patients?",
    "Are you able to recognize common medical emergency patterns?",
    "Do you understand special considerations for different age groups?",
    "Can you communicate effectively with patients and families?",
    "Are you competent in documenting medical patient encounters?"
  ],

  practiceScenarios: [
    "Elderly patient with vague complaints and multiple medical conditions",
    "Middle-aged patient with new onset chest pain and no cardiac history",
    "Young adult with altered mental status and unknown medical history",
    "Pediatric patient with fever and respiratory symptoms",
    "Patient with chronic condition experiencing acute exacerbation",
    "Confused patient with family providing most of the history"
