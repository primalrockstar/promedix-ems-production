  clinicalPearls: [
    "The best airway adjunct is the one that works - be prepared to try different options",

    "Two-person BVM ventilation is significantly more effective than one-person",
    "Hyperventilation is more harmful than underventilation - avoid excessive rates and volumes",
    "If you can ventilate but not intubate, continue ventilating - oxygenation is the priority",
    "Suction time should not exceed 15 seconds in adults, 10 seconds in children",
    "When in doubt, give oxygen - hypoxia kills faster than oxygen toxicity",
    "The airway is dynamic - continuously reassess and be ready to intervene"
  ],

  criticalActions: [
    "Recognize signs of airway obstruction or inadequate breathing immediately",
    "Open airway using appropriate manual technique based on injury mechanism",

    "Can you properly size, insert, and secure airway adjuncts?",
