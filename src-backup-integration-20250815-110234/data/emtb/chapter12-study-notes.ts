    "Patient's own medications are generally safer than carrying additional drugs",
    "Onset time varies greatly by route: IV seconds, SL minutes, PO 30-60 minutes",
    "Always have reversal agents and emergency equipment ready",
    "Generic names are more reliable than trade names for communication"
  ],

  criticalActions: [
    "Verify patient identity using two identifiers before any medication",
    "Check medication, dose, and route against order three times",

    "Using expired or improperly stored medications",
    "Giving medications outside scope of practice",
    "Poor documentation or documenting before giving medication",
    "Not monitoring for adverse reactions after administration",
    "Confusing similar medication names or concentrations"
  ],

  assessmentCheckpoints: [
    "Do you understand the difference between generic and trade names?",
    "Can you apply the Six Rights of medication administration consistently?",
    "Are you competent in basic medication calculations and unit conversions?",
    "Do you know your scope of practice regarding medication administration?",
    "Can you recognize and manage common adverse drug reactions?",
    "Do you understand different routes of administration and their implications?",
    "Are you familiar with proper medication storage and handling procedures?",
    "Can you document medication administration completely and accurately?"

  practiceScenarios: [
