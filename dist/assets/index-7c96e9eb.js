**Indications:** Chest pain of cardiac origin, suspected MI
**Dose:** 162-325mg PO (chewable preferred)
**Contraindications:** Allergy, active gastrointestinal bleeding, severe asthma
**Key Point:** Chewing increases absorption rate

**Clinical Pearl:** Give early in suspected ACS for best outcomes`,oxygen:`**Oxygen - EMT-B Administration:**

**Indications:** SpO2 < 94% or signs of hypoxia, respiratory distress, chest pain
**Delivery:** Titrate to maintain SpO2 ≥ 94%; use NRB or BVM if severe distress/CO exposure
**Target:** SpO2 94-99% (avoid hyperoxia in COPD—titrate)
**Monitoring:** Continuous pulse oximetry

**Remember:** Oxygen is a drug - use appropriate concentration!`,gcs:`**Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Assessment:**

**Components:**
• **Eye Opening:** 4-1 points

**Early Signs:**
• Altered mental status
• Tachycardia
• Cool, clammy skin

**EMT Treatment:**
• Oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 94%
• Position supine (legs elevated if no spinal injury)
• Keep warm
• Rapid transport
